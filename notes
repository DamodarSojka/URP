  templates
    parent is only declaring properties that CAN BE (but might not be!) used by child by referencing object properties {{properties[
      nameOfProperty]}}
    when expanded or seen as layout properties are ordered alphabetically
    when property or jijnja2 variable is declared twice (in same scope?) with same value no error is rised 
    when property or jijnja2 variable is declared twice (in same scope?) with DIFF value no error is rised and the latest value is chosen 
      zone: zone-1
      zone: zone-2
      zone-2 will be chosen 
    if some of properties from parent are not used no error is rised
    it is possible to declare some non-existing property (non-existing in the sense that look:hello! probably is not meaningful for GAP) 
      (both directly on template (child) and by referencing properties)

    properties from parent are passed only to direct children, passing it further down inheritance tree requires to assign them again
      otherwise value is just null

    jinja2 variables are scoped to file so
      variable from parent is NOT usable by child directly (no error rised! value will be null!)
      but of course child may use properties[] to access that variable (if property using that variable was declared on parent)

    none existing jinja2/properties variables/references
      when referencing parent by properties that
        is itself a jinja2 variable but is not defined
        is null
        is None
        then value is always None
      when referencing property that does not exists {{properties['notexistingone']}} value is null
      when referencing jinja2 variable not existing in current scope value is null
      null is null, None is None
      but! when if variable is part of the url then instead of null it is just an empty string so ../machineType/
        but at the same time same reference letSeeIfNull: null

    names has to be unique across manifest

    $(ref.name.property) are not resolved in --preview which is obvious because of for example IP retrieval, but sometimes might be unconveniant
    is name from property is not defined error is rised! (so if name evaluates to null or None it also complains)

  imports
    it is possiblee to import unused template
    it is not possible to import same template multiple times

  confFile
    when importing and using template - if you add property to conf file it won't be used
